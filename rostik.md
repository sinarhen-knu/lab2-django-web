# Rostik's Contributions

## Database Relations and Data Modeling

Rostik established the core database architecture for the restaurant management system by:

- Designing a comprehensive and normalized database schema with appropriate relationships
- Implementing three main models:
  - `Category` - With parent-child relationship for a hierarchical category structure
  - `Ingredient` - For tracking individual ingredients in menu items
  - `MenuItem` - The main model with detailed attributes for the menu items
- Setting up proper model relationships:
  - Foreign keys for Category-MenuItem relationships
  - Many-to-many relationships between MenuItems and Ingredients
  - Self-referential relationships for hierarchical categories
- Creating proper model methods for string representation, ordering, and more
- Implementing a custom save method for automatic slug generation

## Project Setup and Configuration

Rostik was responsible for the initial project configuration:

- Setting up the Django project structure
- Configuring the project settings for development and production environments
- Setting up environmental variables using .env files
- Organizing the application structure (models, views, templates)
- Creating and configuring Django forms

## Testing

Rostik implemented comprehensive testing for the application:

- Created unit tests for models to verify proper creation and relationships
- Implemented view tests to ensure proper template rendering and response codes
- Wrote form validation tests to ensure data integrity
- Set up the pytest configuration for efficient test runs
- Configured test coverage reporting to ensure code quality

Overall, Rostik's work created a solid foundation for the project, with a well-structured database design and comprehensive testing strategy that ensures the application's reliability and maintainability. 

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

To ensure project maintainability and team collaboration, Rostik:

- Created comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
- Wrote detailed setup guides for new developers joining the project
- Documented database schema and relationships with diagrams
- Established coding standards and best practices documentation
- Provided regular knowledge-sharing sessions with team members

Overall, Rostik's work created a solid foundation for the project, with a well-structured database design and comprehensive testing strategy that ensures the application's reliability and maintainability.
